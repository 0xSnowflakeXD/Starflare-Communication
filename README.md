 # TCP Toolkit

Doesn't provide much, but they're fun to play around. Contain an example of TCP communication for nerds or anyone use WebSocket<br>
Feel free to use and distribute this!<br>
 # Tools
 Includes:
```diff
- tcp-spammer: A simple request spammer. (Removed due to how wild it is)
+ tcp-client: A client.
+ tcp-server: Designed to work with tcp-client. Commanding stuff and synchronous chat without websocket!
+ lagger: Self-explanatory name
```
Tutorials can be found. Each tool has its own "readme.md" for usage and stuff.
# Compiling
**Here's what their developers say:**
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> `pkg` has been deprecated with `5.8.1` as the last release. There are a number of successful forked versions of `pkg` already with various feature additions. Further, we’re excited about Node.js 21’s support for [single executable applications](https://nodejs.org/api/single-executable-applications.html). Thank you for the support and contributions over the years. The repository will remain open and archived.

**Fun fact**: I used pkg to compile my code!
